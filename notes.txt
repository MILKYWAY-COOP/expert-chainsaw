        RecipeCard/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
        SearchBar/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
        FavoritesList/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
    screens/
        Home/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
        Favorites/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
        RecipeDetail/
            index.tsx
            styles.ts
    services/
        SpoonacularApi.ts
    context/
        RecipeContext.ts
    types/
        recipe.ts
    index.tsx
